# NewOp. Project (Hackatorns-FS)
# Description about our Project
This website would serve as a platform for individuals to showcase their work, allowing others to view their talents. Through a voting system based on the principles of DAO Projects, users can register their work and receive votes. The prize money distribution would be determined by a Smart Contract, ensuring fairness. Overall, the website aims to connect talented individuals with capitalists and provide a transparent and decentralized platform for talent recognition.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
